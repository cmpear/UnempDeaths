Caveats:
"1. As of April 3, 2017, the underlying cause of death has been revised for 125 deaths in 2014. More information:"
"http://wonder.cdc.gov/wonder/help/ucd.html#2014-Revision."
"2. Data for Broomfield, Colorado (FIPS code 08014) are only available for 2003 and later; for computational purposes, counts and"
"population estimates for 1999-2002 are set to zero. Thus, counts and rates shown in multi-year requests for this entity do not"
"include any data for years prior to 2003, only data for 2003 and later. More information:"
"http://wonder.cdc.gov/wonder/help/ucd.html#Broomfield."
"3. There is a discontinuity in the mortality and population data for Adams, Colorado (FIPS code 08001), Boulder, Colorado (FIPS"
"code 08013), Jefferson, Colorado (FIPS code 08059), and Weld, Colorado (FIPS code 080123) between 2002 and 2003. This"
"discontinuity occurs because territory in each of these four counties has been combined to form a new county, Broomfield,"
"Colorado (FIPS code 08014). Beginning in 2003, deaths and population counts for this territory are reported for Broomfield"
"county and are no longer included with data for Adams, Boulder, Jefferson, and Weld."
"4. Data are Suppressed when the data meet the criteria for confidentiality constraints. More information:"

"5. Death rates are flagged as Unreliable when the rate is calculated with a numerator of 20 or less. More information:"
