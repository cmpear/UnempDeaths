# UnempDeaths
This repository is for the purpose of exploring the relationship of unemployment with homicide, suicide and unintentional deaths.  Its findings are that standard U-3 unemployment does not contribute significantly to homicide, suicide, or unintentional deaths; but, increases in U-5 unemployment, what are called discouraged and marginally attached workers, lead to worrisome rises in homicide, suicide and unintentional deaths.  It gathers and analyzes data from the CDC, Census Bureau, and Bureau of Labor Statistics.

While this project was built to pursue an idle curiousity, the author chose to use organize it using the CRISP-DM framework.
